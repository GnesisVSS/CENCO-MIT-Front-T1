## Project Overview üìç

This project is the frontend for the User Management Platform developed for TalentAlke. The aim is to build a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system, facilitating registration, data entry, and information management. We will be using React and Vite to create a modern, fast, and efficient user interface.
